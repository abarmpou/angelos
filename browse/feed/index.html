<p>This paper presents the results of a pilot study that assesses the effect of passive haptics on the user experience in virtual reality simulations of recreation and sports activities. A virtual reality kayaking environment with realistic physics simulation and water rendering was developed that allowed users to steer the kayak using natural motions. Within this environment the users experienced two different ways of paddling using: a) a pair of typical virtual reality controllers, and b) one custom-made “smart paddle” that provided the passive haptic feedback of a real paddle. The results of this pilot study indicate that the users learned faster how to steer the kayak using the paddle, which they found to be more intuitive to use and more appropriate for this application. The results also demonstrated an increase in the perceived level of enjoyment and realism of the virtual experience.</p>
<p>Kayaking is an outdoor activity that can be enjoyed with easy motions and with minimal skill, and can be performed on equal terms by both people who are physically able and those with disabilities [1]. For this reason, it is an ideal exercise for physical therapy and its efficacy as a rehabilitation tool has been demonstrated in several studies [1-6]. Kayaking simulations offer a minimal-risk environment, which, in addition to rehabilitation, can be used in training and recreational applications [5]. The mechanics of boat simulation in general have been well-studied and led to the design of high-fidelity simulation systems in the past decades [3,7]. These simulators immerse the users by rendering a virtual environment on a projector [1,4,6] or a computer screen that is mounted on the simulator system [2,8]. Furthermore, the users can control the simulation by imitating kayaking motions using remote controls equipped with accelerometers (such as Wii controllers) [5] or by performing the same motions in front of a kinesthetic sensor (such as Kinect sensors) [4,6].</p>
<p>The recent advances in virtual reality technologies and in particular the availability of head mounted displays as self-contained low-cost consumer devices led to the development of highly immersive virtual experiences compared to the conventional virtual reality experiences with wall projectors and computer displays. Kayaking simulations have been published as commercial game titles in these virtual reality platforms [13]. However, the use of head mounted displays in intensive physical therapy exercises bears the risk of serious injuries due to the lack of user contact with the real environment. These risks could potentially be reduced if the users maintained continuous contact with the surrounding objects such as the simulator hardware, the paddle(s), and the floor of the room, with the use of passive haptics. Additionally, the overall user experience can be improved through sensory-rich interaction with the key components of the simulated environment.</p>
<p>This paper assesses the role of passive haptics in virtual kayaking applications. Passive haptics can be implemented in virtual reality systems by tracking objects of interest in real-time and aligning them with identically shaped virtual objects, which results in a sensory-rich experience [9,10]. This alignment between real and virtual objects allows users to hold and feel the main objects of interaction including hand-held objects, tables, walls, and various tools [11,12].</p>
<p>In this paper we present a novel virtual reality kayaking application with passive haptic feedback on the key objects of interaction, namely the paddle and the kayak seat. These objects are being tracked in real-time with commercially available tracking sensors that are firmly attached to them. Although the users’ real-world view is occluded by the head-mounted display, the users can see the virtual representation of these objects and naturally feel, hold, and interact with them. Subsequently, the users can perform natural maneuvers during the virtual kayaking experience by interacting with our “smart” paddle using the same range of motions as in real kayaking.</p>
<p>The proposed system was assessed with a pilot user study (n=10) that tested the following hypotheses: a) The use of passive haptics helps users learn kayaking faster and operate the simulation better compared to the conventional controller-based interaction. b) The use of passive haptics improves the level of immersion while kayaking in virtual reality.</p>
<p>The study was undertaken at the Realities Lab of the Digital Worlds Institute at the University of Florida. The volunteers who participated in this experiment were randomly assigned to the study and the control group and experienced the proposed virtual kayaking system with and without the use of passive haptics respectively. The data collection was performed with pre- and post-test surveys. In addition, the progress of each individual user during kayaking was recorded and the collected timestamps were analyzed.</p>
<p>The results from this study are presented in detail and indicate that the use of passive haptics in this application has a statistically significant impact on the user experience and affects their enjoyment, learning progress, as well as the perceived level of realism of the virtual reality simulation.</p>

<p>This paper presents a novel virtual reality system that offers immersive experiences for instrumental music conductor training. The system utilizes passive haptics that bring physical objects of interest, namely the baton and the music stand, within a virtual concert hall environment. Real-time object and finger tracking allow the users to behave naturally on a virtual stage without significant deviation from the typical performance routine of instrumental music conductors. The proposed system was tested in a pilot study (n=13) that assessed the role of passive haptics in virtual reality by comparing our proposed “smart baton” with a traditional virtual reality controller. Our findings indicate that the use of passive haptics increases the perceived level of realism and that their virtual appearance affects the perception of their physical characteristics.</p>
<p>The use of computer systems in instrumental music conductor education has been a well studied topic even outside the area of virtual reality [1]. Several systems have been proposed that offer targeted learning experiences [2,3] which may also combine gamified elements [6]. In the past decades, several visual interfaces have been designed using the available technologies at each given period of time [4,5,7], which most recently included eye tracking [8] and augmented and virtual reality platforms [3].</p>
<p>Recent advances in real-time object tracking and the availability of such systems as mainstream consumer products has opened new possibilities for virtual reality applications [13, 14,]. It has been shown that the use of passive haptics in VR contribute to a sensory-rich experience [15,16], as users have now the opportunity to hold and feel the main objects of interaction within a given immersive environment, such as tools, handles, and other instruments. For example, tracking the location of a real piano can help beginners learn how to play it using virtual reality [20]. However, the use of passive haptics in virtual environments for music education is an understudied area, because it requires precise real-time tracking of objects that are significantly smaller than a piano, such as hand held musical instruments, bows, batons, etc.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a novel system for enhancing the training of novice instrumental music conductors through a tangible virtual environment. For the purposes of the proposed system a smart baton and a smart music stand have been designed using commercially available tracking sensors (VIVE trackers). The users wear a high-fidelity virtual reality headset (HTC VIVE), which renders the environment of a virtual concert hall from the conductor’s standpoint. Within this environment, the users can feel the key objects of interaction within their reach, namely the baton, the music stand, and the floor of the stage through passive haptics. A real-time hand and finger motion tracking system continuously tracks the left hand of the user in addition to the tracking of the baton, which is usually held in the right hand. This setup creates a natural user interface that allows the conductors to perform naturally on a virtual stage, thus creating a highly immersive training experience.</p>
<p>The main goals of the proposed system are the following: a) Enhance the traditional training of novice instrumental music conductors by increasing their practice time without requiring additional space allocation or time commitment from music players, which is also cost-effective. b) Provide an interface for natural user interaction that does not deviate from the traditional environment of conducting, including the environment, the tools, and the user behavior (hand gesture, head pose, and body posture), thus making the acquired skills highly transferable to the real-life scenario. c) Just-in-time feedback is essential in any educational setting, therefore one of the goals of the proposed system is to generate quantitative feedback on the timeliness of their body movement and the corresponding music signals. d) Last but not least, the proposed system recreates the conditions of a real stage performance, which may help the users reduce stage fright within a risk-free virtual environment [9,10,11,12].</p>
<p>A small scale pilot study (n=13) was performed in order to assess the proposed system and particularly the role of passive haptics in this virtual reality application. The main focus of the study was to test whether the use of passive haptics increases the perceived level of realism in comparison to a typical virtual reality controller, and whether the virtual appearance of a real physical object, such as the baton, affects the perception of its physical characteristics. These hypotheses were tested using A/B tests followed by short surveys. The statistical significance of the collected data was calculated, and the results are discussed in detail.  The reported findings support our hypotheses and set the basis for a larger-scale future study.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discover DaVinci is a novel augmented reality system that incorporates blockchain technology with experiential learning to engage participants in an interactive discovery of Leonardo da Vinci’s ouvre. In the true spirit of this “Renaissance man”, Discover DaVinci explores new ideas and technologies “ahead of their time”.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate the emerging potential at the intersection of art and blockchain, we present a case study of a new interactive system produced at the University of Florida Digital Worlds Institute.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uKWQFqtIuA?feature=oembed" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The technologies of mobile computing, augmented reality (AR), and blockchain are starting to merge, creating new opportunities and scenarios to interact with our environment. In AR we can look at virtual objects superimposed within a real environment and resize them, rotate them, explore and interact with them on multiple levels. With the combination of AR and blockchain, we can create a system capable of keeping track of digital assets located virtually in 3D space (i.e., spatial computing). The global scale of blockchain and related technologies heightens the potential for trade and digital distribution with a fully automated and trusted way to keep track of their creations without a “middle-man”.</p>
<p>Discover DaVinci is a novel educational tool that teaches concepts of blockchain technology through an augmented reality experiential learning game.</p>
<p>This project was developed in collaboration with several units from the University of Florida and industry partners:<br />
• Digital Arts &amp; Sciences Faculty (Computer Science and Digital Worlds Institute)<br />
• Digital Worlds Studios’ Artists and Programmers<br />
• Gator Blockchain Club (gatorblockchainclub.com) – Student-run blockchain club at the University of Florida<br />
• Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (College of Business)<br />
• Creative Campus Committee at the University of Florida<br />
Industry Partners:<br />
• DLUX, decentralized content network (dlux.io)<br />
• Steem (steem.com), and Steemit (steemit.com)<br />
• A-Frame, web VR platform (aframe.io)</p>
<p>Discover DaVinci utilizes the format of a digital, collectible trading &amp; drafting card game with AR elements on the STEEM blockchain. Although each player “owns” their cards, all transactions are public. Every collectible card is a unique token, owned by the player – a digital asset registered to the player’s account. The aim is to draw new question cards daily, answer the questions about Leonardo DaVinci, collect the special AR invention cards, and ultimately submit the accumulated card collection into a drawing for prizes. The app was developed to honor the 500th anniversary of Leonardo Davinci by promoting new and innovative technologies.</p>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, education has been severely impacted across the globe.<br />
Ongoing class sessions are especially important for K-12 students, many of whom benefit<br />
especially from experiential learning that is not typically offered in ad hoc online settings. UF<br />
Digital Worlds Institute professor Angelos Barmpoutis is working in partnership with the UF<br />
Literacy Institute (UFLI) to address this world-wide need with an innovative virtual platform<br />
solution.</p>
<p>The Virtual Word Work Mat (VWWM) is an interactive app designed for literacy instruction,<br />
based on the original physical classroom version of the Word Work Mat created by UF doctoral<br />
student Valentina Contesse. Valentina stated, “I never imagined when I was making Word Work<br />
Mats for my first graders, using file folders and Velcro, that it could be transformed into a<br />
digital tool that teachers all over the world would use in their classrooms!”</p>
<p>According to Facebook analytics, just two days after its release date the VWWM had already<br />
reached more than 70,000 people, with more than 6,000 engagements and 300 shares. And<br />
UFLI’s online engagement increased by more than 1000 subscriptions during the same period.<br />
Creating and offering ready access to the Virtual Word Work Mat during pandemic lockdown<br />
has empowered teachers and students continue their literacy instruction as part of their on-line<br />
learning activities. Designed to work on tablet and other devices using the either iOS or Android<br />
platforms, VWWM provides a simple user interface in which students can manipulate letter and<br />
phoneme cards with intuitive touch gestures and compose words at home.</p>
<p>Holly Lane, Director of UFLI said, “We’re so excited about the partnership between the UF<br />
Literacy Institute and Digital Worlds in our response to the pandemic. Thanks to the<br />
commitment and technical expertise of Angelos Barmpoutis, we were able to take some our<br />
interactive literacy instruction materials and bring them to life on a virtual platform. The<br />
response from teachers has been overwhelmingly positive. We have many thousands of<br />
teachers accessing the materials and sharing the links on social media.”</p>
<p>This excitement is shared by Digital Worlds Director James Oliverio. “One of the great benefits<br />
of experiential online learning is accessibility across the traditional challenges of demographics,<br />
geography, and time zones. This project is an example of the interdisciplinary strengths of the<br />
University of Florida; faculty stepping up in a time of need to provide tangible benefits from the<br />
ongoing research and development happening across our campus.”</p>
<p>UFLI Director Lane also stated, “Together, UFLI and DW are making a difference for teachers<br />
and their students. We hope this is just the beginning of our collaboration!”</p>
<p><strong>Sample Comments from Parents and Teachers:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I used this for the first time yesterday in my virtual reading lesson with my struggling readers.<br />
Their response was priceless. They were so engaged and actively asking me to change the<br />
letters and make new words”</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been amazing for my daughter with a severe Auditory Processing Disorder and<br />
dysgraphia. Thank you!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is amazing— thank you! Can’t wait to share with my teachers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is immeasurably helpful!!!!&#8221;</p>
