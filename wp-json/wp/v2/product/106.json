A pilot study of 25 human subjects was performed that focused on: a) testing the capability of the system to guide the users in arbitrary motion paths in the space and b) comparing the motion of the users during typical physical therapy exercises with and without haptic-based guidance. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this paper a prototype system is presented for home-based physical tele-therapy using a wearable device for haptic feedback.
