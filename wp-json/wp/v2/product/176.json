Here we examine algorithms for the adaptive shape change of smart dust modes that permits a change in drag coefficient depending on whether or not the random motion is in a favourable direction. Monte Carlo simulations are reported for swarms of smart dust devices transporting in the wind-dominated environment of the Martian landscape. It is concluded that relatively simple shape changing algorithms, activated through an electro-active polymer sheath, will permit self-organised transport over large distances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Smart dust is envisaged as swarms of miniature communication\/sensor devices useful for remote monitoring in space exploration.
