Statistical analysis of the data collected from post-study questionnaires indicated a shift in perception of size and weight when exposed to the haptic-enhanced simulation, with virtual objects perceived as larger or heavier. It was also noted that the observed shift of the user perception was stronger when the simulation with the tangible surface was experienced first. The paper presents details on the implementation of the air hockey simulation and the setup within the testing environment as well as the statistical analysis performed on the collected data, offering practical recommendations for future applications.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This paper presents a pilot study that explores the role of low-cost passive haptics on how users perceive physical properties such as the size and weight of objects within virtual reality environments.
