This paper focuses on the quantitative part of our framework, which uses a depth camera to capture the patient&#8217;s body motion. More specifically, we present a model-free graph-based segmentation algorithm that detects the regions of the arms and legs in the depth frames. Then, we analyze their motion patterns in real-time by extracting various features such as the pace, length of stride, symmetry of walking pattern, and arm-leg synchronization. Several experimental results are presented that demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed methods.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this paper a novel augmented-reality environment is presented for enhancing locomotor training.
