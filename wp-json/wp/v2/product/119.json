The rest of the chapter is organized into two sections that discuss specific examples of virtual environments for experiential learning and therapeutic medical applications respectively. More specifically, the examples will demonstrate: the use of low-cost haptic devices in virtual environments for learning nanotechnology, experiential learning environments for forest education, the use of virtual reality theaters as an educational tool in the arts and the humanities, virtual environments for therapeutic solutions, interactive tools for treating motor disabilities using brain-computer interface for interaction with virtual environments, and experiential learning applications for microsurgical training using mixed reality and haptic feedback. The chapter concludes with a final section that discusses future research directions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This chapter presents examples of utilizing virtual environments for experiential learning and training purposes, with applications to several areas in the Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics (STEM), and Health Sciences.
