Avatars can be synthesized from the RGB-D data received from a single RGB-D camera by performing body segmentation (into cylindrical-type objects) and dynamic robust data filtering on sequential frames of the captured data. Cylindrical-type objects of the body, including arms, legs, and torso are parameterized using tensor splines; and positive-definite constrains are imposed to the estimated tensor splines using a Riemannian metric defined on the space of positive-definite tensor splines.
