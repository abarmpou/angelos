The results produced are optimized, either by taking into consideration anthropometric features, or by using a 3D model of the human face. In that way, the initial prediction is greately improved and the resulting accuracy is more than satisfactory. Such rechniques could process videos displaying news, journalists, actors or even people in general, or even be used in object-based techniques for video coding (eg. MPEG-4), in machine vision applications and in human computer interaction enviroments.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this paper an algorithm that processes a video sequence for humean face 3D pose estimation, is presented.
