UF<br \/>\nDigital Worlds Institute professor Angelos Barmpoutis is working in partnership with the UF<br \/>\nLiteracy Institute (UFLI) to address this world-wide need with an innovative virtual platform<br \/>\nsolution.<\/p>\n<p>The Virtual Word Work Mat (VWWM) is an interactive app designed for literacy instruction,<br \/>\nbased on the original physical classroom version of the Word Work Mat created by UF doctoral<br \/>\nstudent Valentina Contesse. Valentina stated, \u201cI never imagined when I was making Word Work<br \/>\nMats for my first graders, using file folders and Velcro, that it could be transformed into a<br \/>\ndigital tool that teachers all over the world would use in their classrooms!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Facebook analytics, just two days after its release date the VWWM had already<br \/>\nreached more than 70,000 people, with more than 6,000 engagements and 300 shares. And<br \/>\nUFLI\u2019s online engagement increased by more than 1000 subscriptions during the same period.<br \/>\nCreating and offering ready access to the Virtual Word Work Mat during pandemic lockdown<br \/>\nhas empowered teachers and students continue their literacy instruction as part of their on-line<br \/>\nlearning activities. Designed to work on tablet and other devices using the either iOS or Android<br \/>\nplatforms, VWWM provides a simple user interface in which students can manipulate letter and<br \/>\nphoneme cards with intuitive touch gestures and compose words at home.<\/p>\n<p>Holly Lane, Director of UFLI said, \u201cWe\u2019re so excited about the partnership between the UF<br \/>\nLiteracy Institute and Digital Worlds in our response to the pandemic. Thanks to the<br \/>\ncommitment and technical expertise of Angelos Barmpoutis, we were able to take some our<br \/>\ninteractive literacy instruction materials and bring them to life on a virtual platform. The<br \/>\nresponse from teachers has been overwhelmingly positive. We have many thousands of<br \/>\nteachers accessing the materials and sharing the links on social media.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This excitement is shared by Digital Worlds Director James Oliverio. \u201cOne of the great benefits<br \/>\nof experiential online learning is accessibility across the traditional challenges of demographics,<br \/>\ngeography, and time zones. This project is an example of the interdisciplinary strengths of the<br \/>\nUniversity of Florida; faculty stepping up in a time of need to provide tangible benefits from the<br \/>\nongoing research and development happening across our campus.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>UFLI Director Lane also stated, \u201cTogether, UFLI and DW are making a difference for teachers<br \/>\nand their students. We hope this is just the beginning of our collaboration!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sample Comments from Parents and Teachers:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I used this for the first time yesterday in my virtual reading lesson with my struggling readers.<br \/>\nTheir response was priceless. They were so engaged and actively asking me to change the<br \/>\nletters and make new words\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This has been amazing for my daughter with a severe Auditory Processing Disorder and<br \/>\ndysgraphia. Thank you!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is amazing\u2014 thank you!
