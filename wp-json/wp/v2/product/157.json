In our technique the ODF is modeled by Cartesian tensor basis using a parametrization that explicitly enforces the positive definite property to the computed ODFs. The computed Cartesian tensors, dubbed Cartesian Tensor-ODFs (CT-ODFs), are symmetric positive definite tensors whose coefficients can be efficiently estimated by solving a linear system with non-negative constraints. Furthermore, we show how to use our method for converting higher-order diffusion tensors to CT-ODFs, which is an essential task since the maxima of higher-order tensors do not correspond to the underlying fiber orientations. We quantitatively evaluate our method using simulated DW-MR images as well as a real brain dataset from a post-mortem porcine brain. The results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique over several existing multi-fiber reconstruction methods.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this paper we present a novel method for estimating a field of orientation distribution functions (ODF) from a given set of Diffusion- Weighted MR images.
