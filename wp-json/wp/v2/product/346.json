The press release authored by Michelle Jaffee, stated that under the new NIH grant, principal investigators David Vaillancourt, Ph.D.; Angelos Barmpoutis, Ph.D.; and Michael Okun, M.D., will create a new web-based software tool that they will test within the Parkinson Study Group, a large North American network of clinician-researchers evaluating Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in Parkinsonism. Patient recruitment at 19 U.S. sites and two in Canada is scheduled to begin by summer and continue for two years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is new is the use of artificial intelligence for predicting the type of Parkinsonism,\u201d said Barmpoutis, an associate professor and coordinator of research and technology at UF\u2019s Digital Worlds Institute. \u201cIn order to train a computer to identify Parkinsonism, we need to teach it using a lot of data. One solution for that is crowd sourcing \u2014 going around to different institutes that have patients and asking them to contribute to this big project. We try to collect as many data points by creating what I believe is one of the largest databases for this particular type of diagnosis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The press release can be found at:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/explore.research.ufl.edu\/new-ai-tool-to-be-tested-in-nih-funded-study-to-improve-diagnosis-of-parkinsons-and-related-disorders.html\">https:\/\/explore.research.ufl.edu\/new-ai-tool-to-be-tested-in-nih-funded-study-to-improve-diagnosis-of-parkinsons-and-related-disorders.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p>and was also broadcasted by other news outlets:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drugdiscoverynews.com\/ai-against-parkinsons-disease-15141\">https:\/\/www.drugdiscoverynews.com\/ai-against-parkinsons-disease-15141<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcareitnews.com\/ai-powered-healthcare\/researchers-turn-ai-help-diagnosing-parkinson-s\">https:\/\/www.healthcareitnews.com\/ai-powered-healthcare\/researchers-turn-ai-help-diagnosing-parkinson-s<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/healthitanalytics.com\/news\/artificial-intelligence-tool-seeks-to-enhance-parkinsons-diagnosis\">https:\/\/healthitanalytics.com\/news\/artificial-intelligence-tool-seeks-to-enhance-parkinsons-diagnosis<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/parkinsonsnewstoday.com\/news\/nih-5m-grant-supports-testing-computer-aided-way-of-early-diagnosis\/\">https:\/\/parkinsonsnewstoday.com\/news\/nih-5m-grant-supports-testing-computer-aided-way-of-early-diagnosis\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The University of Florida made a press release about our new AI tool for Parkinson&#8217;s diagnosis.
