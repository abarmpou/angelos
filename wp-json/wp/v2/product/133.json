In this paper, a generalized method is presented for integrating computer education with other learning topics, such as algebra, geometry, music, and 3D art, using emoticoding. The proposed method is based on the theoretical framework of brain-activating text replacements, which assists students to make connections between the tokens of a typed language (such as computer code) and a set of replacing graphemes (such as interpretative visual or textual replacements). When the computer code is instantly being replaced with graphemes from another learning topic, for example geometric shapes or music notation, the students can build associations between the underlying concepts, which in turn reinforces learning of the associated topics. A work-in-progress user interface with four sets of visual replacements is presented in this paper for substituting the discrete tokens of a computer program (JavaScript) with symbols from algebra, geometry, music notation, and solid shapes. The proposed replacements are demonstrated with computer scripts through the emoticoding framework using learning objectives from K-12 common core standards.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Emoticoding is a technique for learning computer programming that has been shown to improve student learning outcomes and reduce blank page trauma during the students&#8217; first encounter with text editing interfaces.
