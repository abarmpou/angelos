The group will develop an interactive website, host a regular research workshop, and organize events with speakers and filmmakers about technoscience. To engage students with questions of space, place, and time, a faculty member will work with students to build a mobile app for time travel in augmented reality to examine the hidden role of technology on the UF campus. This work will lay the foundation for team-taught and other new courses that will give students the tools to envision how they will \u201cimagineer\u201d the future of the planet while harnessing the power of technologies in environmentally and socially sustainable way.<\/p>\n<p>In Spring 2020 our team will offer a course titled \u201cImagineernig the Technosphere\u201d. The purpose of this course is to respond to the grand challenge question: \u201cHow do technologies influence our lives, then and now?\u201d from the perspectives of our 6 thematic units: 1) Inventions and Sciences, 2) Spaces and Infrastructure, 3) Past and Future, 4) Imagining and Designing, 5) Conservation and Sustainability, 6) Culture and Society. This interdisciplinary approach will equip the students with foundational knowledge and tangible skills through weekly modules and experiential learning activities that will be organized as part of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/abarmpou.github.io\/technosphere\/index.php\/uf-quest-game\/index.html\">\u201cUF Quest Game\u201d<\/a>, a gamified learning experience specially designed for this course. The students will be able to transcend the boundaries of traditional disciplines and demonstrate how the humanities serve as the foundation for understanding science and technology and how this holistic approach could affect our decision making processes in ourselves, and on a planetary scale.<\/p>\n<div class=\"uf18-body-copy\">\n<p><strong>In the humanities class \u201cImagineering the Technosphere,\u201d homework isn\u2019t based on a book chapter, but an adventure through campus guided by the GPS-powered Time Traveler app.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sisters Christine and Reyna Mae Cuales, both taking the class this semester, followed the prompts on the app, which steered them closer to their destination. So far, they\u2019ve visited the Harn Museum of Art, the McKnight Brain Institute, the Baughman Center on Lake Alice and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digitalworlds.ufl.edu\/institute-information\/facilities\/\">Digital Worlds Institute in Norman Hall<\/a>, among others. Today, they\u2019re closing in on a location near the historic central campus. When students successfully navigate to the mystery location using the app, a screen pops up that tells them they\u2019ve arrived, offers some background about the place, and poses a reflection question about the place and its use over time.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Angelos Barmpoutis says the intention of the app \u2014 and its corresponding board game \u2014 is to get students to see their surroundings in a new way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese places are deeply connected to the past and tied to the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get them to think about the things they pass every day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When students followed the app to the Norman Gym, for example, they saw a facility originally used for basketball, its wood floors still visible, hosting a weekend-long\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/globalgamejam.org\/2019\/jam-sites\/university-florida-digital-worlds-institute\">video game design competition<\/a>. The experience gave them an opportunity to reflect on how not only the space but the nature of sports and competition evolved, Barmpoutis said.<\/p>\n<p>Barmpoutis is one of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/abarmpou.github.io\/technosphere\/Technosphere_Spring2020_SyllabusV1.2_AB.pdf\">seven professors<\/a>\u00a0who team teach the class, tackling fields that range from anthropology to historic preservation. Each professor\u2019s lesson includes the hunt for several of the game\u2019s 22 3D printed pieces, which students collect after finding the location and submitting video responses to the questions posed in the app.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/B230Yo5SVmY?feature=oembed\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Walking north on Buckman Drive, the Cuales sisters can see that they\u2019re getting closer to today\u2019s location. Then they cross the street, and app tells them they\u2019ve arrived. It\u2019s Dauer Hall, an Collegiate Gothic brick building from 1936 with arches, bay windows and stained glass that once served as the student union. They record their video response about connection and continuity in historic places, then check the app for their next destination.<\/p>\n<p>Reyna Mae, a pre-health student, and Christine, who\u2019s studying sustainability and the built environment, both say they have discovered academic interests they wouldn\u2019t have known about without the course.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re just focused on your major, you don\u2019t get to explore other classes,\u201d Christine said. \u201cGetting to know all of the professors and fields in this class opens up your eyes.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Imagineering and the Technosphere is a UF Intersections project funded by the Andrew W.
