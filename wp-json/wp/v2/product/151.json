However, the majority of these methods have not been adopted for clinical use due to various reasons, including the computational demands as well as the large complexity of the analyzed neural fiber tracking information. In this paper we present an interactive algorithm for fiber bundle analysis that computes in real time statistics on the variation of the structure, size, and curvature along a fiber bundle. The proposed fiber metrics can be used as markers for diagnosing and monitoring atrophy for epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, hypoxia-ischemia, trauma, Alzheimers disease, and other dementias.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During the last decade the area of Diffusion Weighted MRI analysis has gained significant scientific attention and many techniques have been introduced for analyzing the diffusivity patterns in neural tissues and visualizing the neural fiber tracts.
