This trend has opened up new possibilities for<br \/>\nmuseums to create interactive and immersive experiences using virtual<br \/>\nreality (VR). In collaboration with the Florida Natural History<br \/>\nMuseum, we have developed an interactive VR game that utilizes<br \/>\nthe extensive 3D digital collection of the Florida Museum. The goal<br \/>\nis to enhance the traditional museum experience by immersing<br \/>\nvisitors in dynamic VR environments that showcase 3D museum<br \/>\ncollections within context. Specifically, our VR game highlights 3D<br \/>\nscans of endangered species of underwater creatures in the ocean.<br \/>\nChildren can swim alongside these sea creatures while an AI conversational<br \/>\nagent provides scientific insights. Our VR game was<br \/>\nshowcased to the public at the Florida Natural History Museum during<br \/>\na public outreach event, attracting visits from three K-12 school<br \/>\ntrips.We conducted field observations to evaluate children\u2019s interactions<br \/>\nwith the VR game and conducted semi-structured interviews<br \/>\nwith children\u2019s guardians as well as museum staff. The findings<br \/>\nfrom our observations emphasized the importance of shared experiences<br \/>\namong visitors, which could be facilitated by projecting the<br \/>\nVR gameplay on a large screen to mitigate the isolated nature of<br \/>\nthe HMD VR experience limitations. Additionally, museum staff<br \/>\nemphasized the significance of considering visitor traffic when<br \/>\ndesigning VR experiences in museum settings. The findings also<br \/>\nhighlighted a preference for seated experiences over standing ones<br \/>\ndue to safety concerns related to children colliding with others and<br \/>\nmuseum artifacts. This paper provides an overview of our design<br \/>\nprocess and the challenges of implementing HMD VR in museum<br \/>\nsettings, offering valuable insights for future endeavors aimed at<br \/>\ndesigning public VR educational experiences targeting children.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recent advancements in photogrammetry and 3D LiDAR scanners have led to a noticeable increase in the creation of 3D scans of museum artifacts.
