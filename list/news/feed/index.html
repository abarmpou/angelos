					<description><![CDATA[The University of Florida made a press release about our new AI tool for Parkinson's diagnosis. The press release authored by Michelle Jaffee, stated that under the new NIH grant, principal investigators David Vaillancourt, Ph.D.; Angelos Barmpoutis, Ph.D.; and Michael Okun, M.D., will create a new web-based software tool that they will test within the Parkinson Study Group, a large North American network of clinician-researchers evaluating Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in Parkinsonism. Patient recruitment at 19 U.S. sites and two in Canada is scheduled to begin by summer and continue for two years.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of Florida made a press release about our new AI tool for Parkinson&#8217;s diagnosis. The press release authored by Michelle Jaffee, stated that under the new NIH grant, principal investigators David Vaillancourt, Ph.D.; Angelos Barmpoutis, Ph.D.; and Michael Okun, M.D., will create a new web-based software tool that they will test within the Parkinson Study Group, a large North American network of clinician-researchers evaluating Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in Parkinsonism. Patient recruitment at 19 U.S. sites and two in Canada is scheduled to begin by summer and continue for two years.</p>
<p>“What is new is the use of artificial intelligence for predicting the type of Parkinsonism,” said Barmpoutis, an associate professor and coordinator of research and technology at UF’s Digital Worlds Institute. “In order to train a computer to identify Parkinsonism, we need to teach it using a lot of data. One solution for that is crowd sourcing — going around to different institutes that have patients and asking them to contribute to this big project. We try to collect as many data points by creating what I believe is one of the largest databases for this particular type of diagnosis.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UF Quest Game that was created as part of our Imagineering the Technosphere project was featured on March 11, 2020 in EdScoop, an on-line news outlet for education.</p>
<p>The article was titled &#8220;Immersive app turns U. of Florida campus into educational board game&#8221; and provided a detailed presentation of the project: &#8220;The game, part of a class called “Imagineering the Technosphere,” taps into an app called Time Traveler that uses GPS to navigate students around campus and bestow historical insights into the locations they visit, such as museums, research facilities and event venues. Upon arrival at each location, the app presents historical information and later poses a question that tests students’ comprehension of the information presented. The app also ties into a corresponding physical board game in which students compete against each other for 3D-printed pieces that correspond to the locations visited. &#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our team was happy to find out that the UF Quest Game was featured in the Fall 2019 issue of Ytori Magazine published by the UF College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>The article says that: At the heart of this Intersections Group is the desire to show students that we are all more connected across cultures and even time than we think. For example, when students play the “UF Quest Game,” they’ll stop by the Harn Museum of Art to take a look at a 17th century Korean bodhisattva sculpture and be compelled to consider the piece on a variety of levels. What technology was used to make it? What purpose did it serve? What does it mean to them, the students, sitting in front of them here in Florida, thousands of miles away from where it was originally created, hundreds of years later?</p>

Part of the project, specifically the Digital Epigraphy Toolbox, was previously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and was recently completed and released for public use.</p>
<p>The article states that &#8220;Since its creation, the toolbox has been presented at national and international conferences, such as the 104th American Institute of Archaeology Annual Meeting and the 13th Congress of Greek and Latin Epigraphy hosted by Oxford University. In 2012 it placed second in an international competition for an eHumanities Digital Innovation Award; the competition was hosted by the University of Leipzig in Germany. The National Archives [UK] used the toolbox to digitize 13th-16th century artifacts in its collection. More recently, the DEA group teamed up with Cornell University and the Library of Congress to digitize historical documents written by President Lincoln, including the Gettysburg Address.&#8221;</p>
